; PIXI: LIST FILE
; This is a list of all custom sprites to be inserted by PIXI.
; - sprites get listed by their ID number and the config file name (either .cfg or .json).
; - custom normal sprites can start at ID 00 and go up to BF.
; - other sprite types have special considerations, see PIXI's readme for more details.
; Lines with a ; at the start are comments that are ignored by PIXI
